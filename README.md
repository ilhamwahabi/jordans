# dans-github-jobs

## Description

Technical test for PT. Dans Multi Pro.

This app display available jobs from [Github Jobs API](https://jobs.github.com/api) but it proxied through [my own proxy](https://github.com/iwgx/jobbery-api) to bypass CORS. We can filter based on description, location, and is it full time or not. This app also can show detail of the job that we select.

Build with React (with Typescript), styled-components, and other great library.

Deployed to Netlify.
